The Decent.bet platform currently supports the following contracts:

## Pre-requisites

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

* [Ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli)

## Setting up

1. [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

2. Install [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) and [Ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) (beta for Websocket API support)

    ```
        yarn global add truffle ganache-cli@beta
    ```

3. Clone this repository

4. Install the repository packages

    ```
        yarn install
    ```

5. Run Ganache-cli with the following configuration
    
    **For development (Use a network ID of 10)**
    ```
    ganache-cli --mnemonic "mimic soda meat inmate cup someone labor odor invest scout fat ketchup" -i 10
    ```
6. Add a .env file to the current directory with the following variables
   
   ```
   MNEMONIC='<MNEMONIC TO DEPLOY CONTRACTS AND CONTRËšOL THE PLATFORM>'
   INFURA_KEY='<REGISTERED INFURA KEY>'
   DEFAULT_ACCOUNT='<DEFAULT ACCOUNT LINKED TO YOUR MNEMONIC>'
   ```
       
7. Optionally clone the [platform-frontend](https://github.com/decent-bet/platform-frontend), 
   [admin-frontend](https://github.com/decent-bet/admin-frontend), [games-api](https://github.com/decent-bet/games-api) & [platform-contracts-init](https://github.com/decent-bet/platform-contracts-init) repositories

8. Migrate the contracts to your **ganache-cli** instance

    ```
        truffle migrate
    ```

9. Copy the build/contracts directory to your [platform-frontend](https://github.com/decent-bet/platform-frontend), 
   [admin-frontend](https://github.com/decent-bet/admin-frontend), [games-api](https://github.com/decent-bet/games-api) 
   & [platform-contracts-init](https://github.com/decent-bet/platform-contracts-init) directories.
